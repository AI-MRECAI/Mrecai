                    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                      From the very beginning, I've always believed that success comes from understanding the numbers — and then daring to think beyond them. My journey started at the University at Buffalo, where I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Accounting and Finance, graduating Summa Cum Laude and Magna Cum Laude. During my time there, I specialized in <strong>Accounting Systems and Internal Controls</strong>, developing an early passion for how technology could transform financial management and business decision-making.
                    </p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                      While still in school, I competed — and won — several <strong>PwC accounting competitions, technology innovation challenges, and startup pitch competitions</strong>. My entrepreneurial projects gained national recognition and were even featured in national media, reinforcing my belief that technology and finance aren't separate worlds — they're two sides of the same coin.
                    </p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                      After graduation, I refined my skills in the world of high finance and global business. I interned at <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, where I learned how large-scale financial systems truly operate, and later worked at <strong>PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)</strong>, where I deepened my understanding of audit, compliance, and corporate advisory. From there, I transitioned into the private sector, joining <strong>Merlin Entertainments</strong> as a Finance Manager, where I led financial operations, managed cross-functional teams, and implemented systems that drove efficiency, profitability, and growth.

                      But deep down, I always knew I was an entrepreneur at heart. I wanted to build something that didn't just analyze numbers — but used them to empower people and businesses to take control of their futures.

                      That's how <strong>MRE Consulting & Insurance</strong> was born — a firm that merges financial expertise, strategic consulting, and modern technology to provide clients with complete, data-driven solutions. I officially founded MRE Consulting & Insurance in 2024, and by 2025, I made the leap to pursue it full-time.
